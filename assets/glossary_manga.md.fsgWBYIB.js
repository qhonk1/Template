Generally A6 size and thicker than tankoubon, usually with new covers. Bunkoban tends to contain considerably more pages than a tankoubon, meaning the bunko edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes.</td></tr><tr><td>Goukaaizouban</td><td>Luxury favorite edition</td><td>Another term occasionally used to designate a type of special release.</td></tr><tr><td>Kanzenban</td><td>Perfect complete edition</td><td>A special complete edition. Volumes are generally A5 size and will typically include individual chapter covers, color pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, all of which are often omitted or converted to grayscale in standard tankoubon releases.</td></tr><tr><td>Shinsouban</td><td>New decoration edition</td><td>A new edition, usually with special covers, new color pages and other extras.

Volumes are B5 size, larger than a kanzenban. They include chapter covers, color pages, and various bonus features such as posters and interviews. They&#39;re usually reserved for popular manga with ongoing serializations and contain far more pages than a standard tankoubon, thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes.</td></tr><tr><td>Wide-ban</td><td>—</td><td>A larger (A5 size) edition. Many manga, particularly seinen and josei, are published in wide-ban editions after magazine serialization, and are never released in the tankoubon format that is common in shounen and shoujo manga.
