In the case of 0 or bad seeders, you will have to wait for a new seeder to join, or check if a debrid service has the torrent cached.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>What is seedbox &amp; debrid service?</summary><h3 id="seedbox" tabindex="-1">Seedbox <a class="header-anchor" href="#seedbox" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Seedbox&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A seedbox is a remote service that can download (leech) &amp; upload (seed) from p2p networks. Since it&#39;s always online, it keeps the torrents alive, thus helping you keep a high ratio in <a href="#pt-private-tracker">PTs</a>. Examples: <a href="https://ultra.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ultra.cc</a>, <a href="https://www.rapidseedbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RapidSeedbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://pulsedmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pulsed Media</a>.</p><h3 id="debrid" tabindex="-1">Debrid <a class="header-anchor" href="#debrid" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debrid&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Like a seedbox, it&#39;s also a remote service. It can download from p2p and various host sites (e.g. <a href="https://mega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MEGA</a>, <a href="https://rapidgators.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RapidGator</a>). One of the big differences is that they (generally) don&#39;t seed p2p files and keep the downloaded files cached on their servers, meaning you can download currently dead torrents that have already been cached in the past.

In peer-to-peer (P2P) connections such as torrenting, it exposes your IP to everyone connected. So, it&#39;s advisable to use a VPN which will mask your IP. But if your country / ISP doesn&#39;t care about pirating stuff, you can skip VPN. To know whether your country / ISP cares about it, ask in your local forum.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>What VPN should I use? Free or Paid?</summary><p>Paid.
