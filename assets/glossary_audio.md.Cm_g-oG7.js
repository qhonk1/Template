The 3 core devices are the DAC, AMP, and playback device. To briefly explain the signal chain, digital audio needs to be sent to a DAC in order to be converted into a usable analog signal. That analog signal is then amplified to bring it to a listenable volume. Finally, a headphone, IEM, or speaker is plugged into the amplifier to reproduce the sound. This chain holds true for any form of digital media, but analog sources do not require a DAC, as the audio signal is already in the analog form.</p>',11)),t("h2",ge,[e[41]||(e[41]=a("DAC ")),i(s,{heading:"DAC"}),e[42]||(e[42]=t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#dac","aria-label":'Permalink to "DAC"'},"​",-1))]),e[84]||(e[84]=t("p",null,"The DAC, or Digital to Analog Converter, takes in digital bitstreams and converts them into analog signals.

Specifically the headphone, IEM, and speaker.</p><h3 id="headphone" tabindex="-1">Headphone <a class="header-anchor" href="#headphone" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Headphone&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A headphone is 2 speaker drivers held together by a headband. They can be wired, bluetooth, or wireless with a dongle. To briefly explain the differences:</p><ul><li><p>Wired headphones are passive devices that can be plugged into anything with an audio jack. If it terminates in a 3.5mm or usb-c, then it may be plugged into its respective port. Bluetooth headphones are wireless, although many still offer a cable for an optional passive use.</p></li><li><p>Audio sent via bluetooth is always compressed with lossy compression, and even with modern bluetooth standards, there is no getting around that. Wireless headphones aren&#39;t restricted by the bluetooth encoding standards. The audio may be sent losslessly to the device. The downside is that they typically require a hub or wireless dongle to connect to. This severely limits the amount of devices they could potentially be connected to.</p></li></ul><p>Headphones can have two distinct varieties. Closed back &amp; Open back headphones.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Closed back</strong> designs involve a sealed backplate to enclose the driver. This is the most common design, although it presents a larger challenge for acoustically tuning the headphone. When a driver is sealed, the audio that is hitting the backplate must be properly filtered in order to provide a pleasant sound for the listener. This filtering can be achieved with physical design solutions, such as foams, felts, or vents for certain frequencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Open back</strong> headphones, alternatively, utilize a perforated backplate. This backplate allows sound to be shot outside of the headphone, yielding a less restrictive physical design. There are other benefits, such as open backs generally producing a wider soundstage, which is how far away a sound is perceived from the listener. Open backs are regarded as being easier to tune than closed backs, and some believe the sound of an open back is “more natural.” Even with these benefits, open backs remain a less commonly owned variant. Open back headphones project sound outside of the headphone. Most users seek privacy in the content they listen to, making a closed back a more private and desirable option.</p></li></ul><h3 id="in-ear-monitor" tabindex="-1">In Ear Monitor <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-ear-monitor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;In Ear Monitor&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In ear monitors, or IEMs for short, are devices intended to be inserted into the ear for audio playback. This allows them to be a more private option for listening to music while retaining an even frequency response. IEMs are built similarly to earbuds, however, they are designed with nozzles that the music is shot out of. These nozzles are fitted with eartips, which are then inserted into the ear and suspended by the tip. This allows the tip to seal within the ear, decreasing the sound that leaks out while increasing the depth at which sound can travel. This process especially enhances the bass response.</p><details class="details custom-block"><summary>More</summary><p>IEM configurations can be very complex. They commonly utilize multiple different drivers in a single shell. These multiple different driver type configurations are referred to as “hybrids”, and are very common within the IEM space. The main argument for their existence is that no one driver can perfectly reproduce the audio spectrum. Some driver types fail at applications that other driver types may excel at. Configuring an IEM with different types of drivers, and designing a crossover to split frequencies between these drivers should enhance the overall fidelity. In practice, there are very good single driver, multi driver, and hybrid driver configurations on the market. It all comes down to user preference.</p></details><h3 id="speaker" tabindex="-1">Speaker <a class="header-anchor" href="#speaker" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Speaker&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Speakers are drivers within enclosures a set distance away from the listener. The sound travels, bounces, and fills up the room until it reaches the listener, creating the effect of a vast wall of sound. Configurations vary more widely than their headphone and IEM counterparts, but their fundamental concepts of sound reproduction are the same. The primary advantage of speakers is their lack of size restrictions, allowing for larger and more complex designs to exist.</p><p>A singular driver will not do a good job at reproducing the entire sound spectrum. Generally, a driver will have a portion of sound it excels at. This is especially true for drivers used in speakers. Speakers consist of 3 driver types:</p><ol><li>Subwoofer</li><li>Woofer and</li><li>Tweeter.</li></ol><p>Each driver type handles a different part of the frequency spectrum. Most commonly, a woofer and tweeter will be paired within the same enclosure. A subwoofer would be detached and contained within its own enclosure.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Driver</th><th>Work</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Subwoofer</td><td>The subwoofer, which is also the name for the type of speaker, is the driver that specializes in very low frequencies. These are at and below 80Hz, but many subwoofers allow the user to increase or decrease this ceiling.</td></tr><tr><td>Woofer</td><td>The woofer is optimized for the middle frequencies. The middle frequencies are defined by the crossover between the subwoofer and the woofer, but from around 80 Hz to 2kHz is common. The crossover should be defined by the capabilities of the woofer, such that the subwoofer can make up for where the woofer lacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Tweeter</td><td>The tweeter will handle frequencies between around 2kHz-20kHz. Tweeters can play frequencies beyond 20kHz, but humans aren’t able to perceive them. A woofer paired with a tweeter is the most common speaker configuration, known as a 2-way speaker.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Speakers achieve frequency separation between drivers with use of a crossover. This crossover can be passive or active, and functions as a filter for the frequencies. These frequency separations are not instantaneous, as frequencies will bleed into both drivers at the crossover point. This is both due to a limitation of frequency filtering circuits as well as making the crossover sound more natural.</p><figure><img src="'+Y+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><details class="details custom-block"><summary>More</summary><p>Speakers come in two distinct types, active or passive units.</p><ul><li><strong>Passive units</strong> are unpowered. These devices only have speaker terminals in the back, intended to be hooked up to an external amplifier or AVR. Sound is played back as amplified signal passes through them. An external DAC and amp are required to make use of them (unless the source was analog, in which case, only an amp).</li><li><strong>Active units</strong>, on the other hand, are powered. This implies they contain amplification circuitry (and potentially DAC circuitry) internally. Usually, these powered units will take a DC barrel plug, or a standard IEC cable in the back. They also can provide analog inputs for the internal amplifier, such as RCA or XLR. Digital inputs may also be present if the speaker contains a DAC, such as toslink optical or Bluetooth. These components, as well as the circuitry, are mounted onto a plate and screwed into the speaker. Subwoofers are commonly active units, as they allow for much more control over the subwoofer’s crossover.</li></ul></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Surround system identification</summary><p>Surround sound systems are commonly denoted by a number naming scheme.</p><ul><li>The first number indicates the amount of speakers at the same level as the listener that are also pointed at the listener.</li><li>The second number denotes the amount of subwoofers within the setup.</li><li>The third, optional number denotes the amount of speakers that are either not pointed directly at the listener, or are ceiling mounted.</li></ul><p>These 3 number configurations usually imply a Dolby Atmos enabled system.</p></details>',19)),t("h2",be,[e[47]||(e[47]=a("Frequency Response ")),i(s,{heading:"Frequency Response"}),e[48]||(e[48]=t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#frequency-response","aria-label":'Permalink to "Frequency Response"'},"​",-1))]),e[93]||(e[93]=t("div",{class:"info custom-block"},[t("p",{class:"custom-block-title"},"Summary"),t("p",null,"The frequency response shows how something sounds across the frequency spectrum, in terms of gain.

Sound can be flavored to a user’s preferences, with no cost to the user.</p></div><p>Equalization, also shortened to eq, allows you to alter the frequency response of a playback device. This can be very useful if a particular section of the frequency response is not so pleasant to listen to, such as it being too loud or too quiet. Equalization can easily be performed on a desktop computer or a mobile phone, although there are also dedicated devices.</p><p>While this is a very powerful tool, there are still limitations to equalization. If the users wanted to make certain frequencies louder, it&#39;s not as simple as raising the level. For example, the user wanted 80 Hz tones to appear louder. In an eq, those tones are raised by +3 db. This would make 80 Hz frequencies louder, however, the eq is digitally amplifying the signal. Digital audio has a maximum loudness it can achieve, and if that loudness gets exceeded, the sound will distort. There is a simple solution to this problem. Most equalizers have a feature that sets the maximum gain across all bands to 0db. This is basically shifting the entire equalization down until the top most slider is equal to 0db. In other words, instead of making a sound louder, you&#39;re making the rest of the frequency spectrum quieter. In order to make up for this loss in gain, more analog amplification is required to meet the difference.</p><p>The second limitation of EQ is that it can&#39;t make a bad piece of hardware good. Eq can definitely make any piece of hardware sound better, but it can&#39;t turn a $10 gas station headphone into something that would please an audiophile. If a piece of hardware isn&#39;t offering a fidelity the user desires, the user should look at better hardware to satisfy their desires.</p><figure><img src="'+X+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is an example of the bass boost eq profile in musicbee. The preamp is set to -6dB, which is larger in magnitude than the largest magnitude of the boosted frequencies. This ensures that no peaking occurs on the output.

Frequencies around 32 Hz receive the greatest effect.</p><figure><img src="'+Q+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h1 id="japanese-music-genres" tabindex="-1">Japanese Music Genres <a class="header-anchor" href="#japanese-music-genres" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Japanese Music Genres&quot;">​</a></h1><br><p>There are multiple genres that are distinctly Japanese, all with different origins and established in different periods of time.

With the help of <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NicoNico Douga</a>, a japanese video sharing platform, Vocaloid would skyrocket in popularity within the underground doujin scene. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hatsune Miku</a>’s cover of &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/widZEAJc0QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Ievan Polkka</strong></a>&quot; in particular would garner the genre massive exposure.

With its extensive array of voice banks, Vocaloid encompasses a huge variety of genres and styles within its own umbrella of synthetically constructed vocals. While not a concrete number, there are easily around 100 officially licensed Vocaloid voice banks as of 2024, not counting rereleases. Factoring in vocal synths, as well as the publicly available utau voice banks, this number becomes astronomically higher. Essentially, the capabilities of Vocaloid software allow for an endless amount of user expression.</p><p>Vocaloid would slowly gain traction after the release of Vocaloid 2. The doujin scene in particular would latch onto the easy to use software to make up for the lack of a vocalist. The voicebanks were there to use, and could be warped to whatever sound and aesthetic the producer desired. Hatsune Miku in particular would become a sort of icon for the genre, with her design being plastered all across the internet and Japan alike. Sega would consistently tie Hatsune Miku into spinoff games, such as the Project Diva rhythm game series. The internet would create animations in software such as Adobe Flash, as well as fanart of Hatsune Miku. The art and animations would accompany releases in a sort of Vocaloid mixed media production. All of this tied into mass exposure for the genre, and especially the brand. Even today, these traditions are still being honored in modern Vocaloid releases.</p><p>Everything from jpop to metal to hard trance is fair game for Vocaloid. While the term refers to a genre in of itself, it&#39;s more akin to how non-specific something like “female vocals” would be. The only qualification for a Vocaloid song is for it to contain vocals from some sort of vocaloid/utau voicebank.

As such, the Jcore scene sees mass international exposure to people within the rhythm game subculture.",-1)),e[112]||(e[112]=t("p",null,[a("Producers in the J-Core scene worth checking out consist of "),t("a",{href:"https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCkuWrVX6ME6koqF5AehTkmw",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},[t("strong",null,"DJ Sharpnel")]),a(" and "),t("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/@torienaofficial",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},[t("strong",null,"TORIENA")]),a(".")],-1)),t("h2",qe,[e[63]||(e[63]=a("Idol ")),i(s,{heading:"Idol"}),e[64]||(e[64]=t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#idol","aria-label":'Permalink to "Idol"'},"​",-1))]),e[113]||(e[113]=o('<p>Idol music falls under the multi-media umbrella of Japanese idol culture. Idols are teenage girls that are over-marketed into superstars for an otaku audience. Ideas of escapism, maximalism, and aesthetics are core to the subculture. Idols normally don&#39;t have prior knowledge from a performance background. Rather, studios will engineer idols into performance artists with strict and unorganized schedules. Many social freedoms are restricted, such as visiting family and drinking/smoking. A distinct image must be upheld, an image that has been core to the subculture since the beginning.</p><p>The music itself consists of a variety of genres. Denpa, Jpop, and Jrock are all fair game for idol groups. Experimentation is welcome within the genre, but the music is going to be dictated by the studio that hired the idol. Groups such as Babymetal are iconic for combining metal with more popish, traditional idol vocals.</p><p>You can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@akb48/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>AKB48</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BABYMETAL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>BABYMETAL</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HoshimachiSuisei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Hoshimachi Suisei</strong></a>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Where to purchase Japanese Music?</p><p>Give the <a href="/music#purchase">Wotaku music page</a> a look.
